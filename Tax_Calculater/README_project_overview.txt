Project Title: Tax Calculator Web Application

Overview:
-----------
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to calculate their income tax, save their tax records, and manage their tax history. It is built using a FastAPI backend (Python), a PostgreSQL database, and a Streamlit frontend for a modern, interactive user experience.

Key Features:
-------------
1. **User Registration & Login:**  
   - Users can register with a username, email, and password.
   - Secure authentication using JWT tokens.

2. **Tax Calculation:**  
   - Users can input their gross annual salary and select a tax year.
   - The app calculates tax paid, net salary, and tax rate based on Indian tax slabs.

3. **Save & Manage Tax Records:**  
   - Authenticated users can save their tax calculations as records.
   - Users can view, edit, and delete their tax records.
   - Visualizations (charts, tables) help users understand their tax trends over time.

4. **Profile & Statistics:**  
   - Users can view their profile information and account statistics.
   - Summary metrics like total tax paid, total records, and average tax rate.

5. **Quick Calculator:**  
   - Non-logged-in users can use a quick calculator (without saving records).

Technology Stack:
-----------------
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Pandas

How It Works (Step-by-Step):
----------------------------
1. **User registers or logs in.**
2. **User navigates to "Calculate Tax" page, enters salary and tax year, and clicks "Calculate".**
3. **The backend calculates tax and returns the breakdown.**
4. **User can save the calculation as a record.**
5. **Saved records are stored in PostgreSQL and can be viewed, edited, or deleted.**
6. **Profile and statistics pages show user info and tax summaries.**

How to Explain to Others:
-------------------------
- This project demonstrates a complete workflow for a modern web app: authentication, data processing, persistent storage, and interactive UI.
- It is suitable for anyone who wants to track their tax calculations over time, compare different years, and manage their tax data securely.
- The backend is robust and production-ready, while the frontend is user-friendly and visually appealing.

How to Run:
-----------
1. **Start PostgreSQL and ensure your database is set up.**
2. **Run the FastAPI backend:**  
   `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
3. **Run the Streamlit frontend:**  
   `streamlit run backend/frontend/app.py`
4. **Open the app in your browser and start using it!**

Customization:
--------------
- You can update tax calculation logic in `crud.py` to match different countries or rules.
- The UI can be themed or extended with more analytics.

Summary:
--------
This project is a great example of a real-world, full-stack Python application with authentication, data persistence, and interactive analytics. It is easy to use, easy to extend, and ready to demo or
